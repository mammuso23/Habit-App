This is a habit tracker app that is not only technically sound but also practically helpful in promoting consistency, accountability, and self-reflection. 
The primary goal of this application is to allow users to: 
Define personal habits with a set frequency (daily or weekly), 
Mark them as completed within a given period, 
Monitor their consistency through calculated streaks, 
And analyse habit trends using core statistics.
